## Prediction of CO2 emission and Fuel Consumption of Vehicles Based on Fuel Type and Engine Specifications.
I've chosen this dataset as it could be useful in a marketing perspective.  Attempting to predict the best combination of engine specifications as well as fuel type in regards to finding a perfect balance for fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. This is useful as there are limits to the amount of CO2 a car can produce whilst trying to make an advertisable fuel economy.
